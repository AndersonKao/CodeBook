\subsubsection{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Vertex Cover: Pick some vertices s.t. each edge covered by a least one vertex
	\item Matching : Pick some edge s.t. no two edge share same vertex.
	\item Indepentent vertex Set: Pick some vertices s.t. no two vertices are neighbor.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Konig's Theorem}

In any bipartite graph, the number of edges in a maximum matching equals the number of vertices in a minimum vertex cover.

\subsubsection{Independent Set on Bipartite graph}

In any bipartite graph, the complement of mimimum vertex cover is a maximum Independent set.
