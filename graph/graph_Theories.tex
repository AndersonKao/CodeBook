\subsubsection{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
	\item Vertex Cover: Pick some vertices s.t. each edge covered by a least one vertex
	\item Matching : Pick some edge s.t. no two edge share same vertex.
	\item Indepentent vertex Set: Pick some vertices s.t. no two vertices are neighbor.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Konig's Theorem}

In any bipartite graph, the number of edges in a maximum matching equals the number of vertices in a minimum vertex cover.

\subsubsection{Independent Set on Bipartite graph}

In any bipartite graph, the complement of mimimum vertex cover is a maximum Independent set.

\subsubsection{Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover}

二分圖的minimum weighted vertex cover可以透過最大流求出，建模方式如下：source 連向所有左邊的點，capacity是點權，所有右邊的點連向sink，capacity是點權，對於二分圖中原本有的邊，從左邊連向右邊，capacity為INF。可以透過此圖的 min cut構造出 vertex cover，而min cut可以透過此圖的 max flow 求出。

\subsubsection{Biconnected Component}
If a Biconnected component is 2-connected
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
	\item it has a least three vertices. (special case: 2 vertex and one edge)
	\item 表示任兩點間存在兩條互斥路徑(環)。且認兩邊可以找到一個環包含兩邊
	\item 若該連通分量有一個奇環則雙連通分量的任一點都至少一個奇環覆蓋
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{DFS Tree}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
	\item The back-edges of the graph all connect a vertex with its descendant in the spanning tree.
	\item A back-edge is never a bridge. The edge between u and its parent is a bridge if and only if $\mathrm{dp}[u] = 0$ ( $\mathrm{dp}[u] = (\text{\# of back-edges going up from } u) - (\text{\# of back-edges going down from } u) + \underset{v \text{ is a child of } u}{\sum \mathrm{dp}[v]} )$.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Euler Tour}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
	\item An undirected graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component.
	\item An undirected graph can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles if and only if all of its vertices have even degree. So, a graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint cycles and its nonzero-degree vertices belong to a single connected component.
	\item An undirected graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have odd degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component
	\item A directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has equal in degree and out degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component. Equivalently, a directed graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if it can be decomposed into edge-disjoint directed cycles and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single strongly connected component.
	\item A directed graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if at most one vertex has $(out-degree) − (in-degree) = 1$, at most one vertex has $(in-degree) − (out-degree) = 1$, every other vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree, and all of its vertices with nonzero degree belong to a single connected component of the underlying undirected graph.
\end{enumerate}
